# Sentiment-Analysis
Sentiment Analysis Approaches
This repository demonstrates different approaches to Sentiment Analysis, progressing from simple rule-based methods to advanced deep learning architectures. It serves as both a learning resource and a practical toolkit for analyzing text sentiment in domains such as social media, product reviews, and customer feedback.

Repository Structure

Rule-Based Approach
Implements text preprocessing, tokenization, and sentiment scoring using lexicons and handcrafted rules.
Good for simple, interpretable use cases.

Machine Learning Approach
Uses traditional models such as Logistic Regression, Na√Øve Bayes, and SVM.
Feature engineering via Bag-of-Words and TF-IDF representations.

Deep Learning Approach
Implements neural networks (RNNs, LSTMs, GRUs) and transformer-based models.
Capable of capturing complex semantic patterns and context.

Features
Preprocessing pipeline: tokenization, stopword removal, stemming/lemmatization
Multiple sentiment classification levels: positive, negative, neutral
Comparative experiments across rule-based, ML, and DL methods
Well-documented Jupyter notebooks and scripts
Evaluation metrics (accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score)
